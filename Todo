Clipping is not working for, e.g. 
  hist(...)
  points(density(...))

Killing the window via the frame buttons causes R to crash
  We shouldn't be involved here. Get the Destory and events right.

<lattice>
In the lattice example

  no text in the panel titles.
    WX_Text not getting called for these unless canClip is set.
    Issue with clipping, see GEText and clipText in engine.c

    When setting the brush, make certain to reset it to 


 Everything on Y scale is too low:
    labels on horizontal (top and bottom) too low
        lattice labels in the tick marks

    alignment of labels on vertical axis too low.
  See the computations in WX_Text.


   These are the same on the Gtk 1 device at least.
</lattice>

Rotated text needs to be aligned properly on vertical axis.
   Approximately correct for 0 and 90 degrees.

Fix up the embedded widget.
  * Basic setup is fine.
  * But need to figure out the drawing context (wxDC) and when it 
       is being destroyed and when we need a new one.
     There may be memory leaks.

  * <Done>Need to determine the size of the widget when we plot to it
      the first time when it is embedded or, preferably, determine
      the size from an event  when it is shown/displayed/realized.
      Even with calls to RESET_SIZE doesn't do it. Need to catch the
      realization event.

      call RESET_SIZE() in wxDeviceDriver() for embedded case.


Resize events need to tell R about the new size.
  Needs to be faster.

use a pixmap to draw or a double-buffered wxDC type.


Mouse actions. 
  canGenMouseDown, ...


Mixing x11 and wxWidgets  causes grief

  plot(1:10, font = 3)
  library(RwxWidgets);  .Call("R_wxWidgets_wxInitialize"); library(RwxDevice);
  wx()
  plot(1:10, font = 3)
  .Call("R_wxWidgets_init", "R")

     Error: unimplemented type 'any' in 'eval'

  


######################################################################################

connect the event loop on X11 at least.
  use gtk on X11.
  Can we detect how wxWidgets was compiled?



######################################################################################
Done:

Circle - find out why the radius is 0.
  set the cra in the wxDeviceDriver correctly

canClip  - 
 set to TRUE but then lots of problems.
 add the clipping ability in wxDeviceDriver back.
    turned it on but the contents of the plot don't appear.

 clipping region is initially and frequently after that set
 to negative left side, e.g. -261.***



caHAdj is 0 - correct?
  Same as devGTK2
