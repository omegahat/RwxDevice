* Fonts
    Handle the specification not via a string, but with sizes, etc.
    Map family/face  appropriately to wxWidgets.


Fix the fonts and ascent/descent.

Make RwxLoadFont behave as it should and not short circuited just
for compilation purposes.

Add locator back.


Set the pen in the DC each time we change it.
Same for brush.

Keep the pens and brushes fixed across calls,
i.e. not on the stack.
